# Azure Service Health:
 
Azure Service Health is a comprehensive solution within Microsoft Azure that enables users to monitor the status of Azure resources, both at a global level and for individually deployed resources. It integrates three main Azure services:
 
1. Azure Status: Offers a broad overview of the global Azure infrastructure's status, providing information on service outages across all Azure regions. Users can access the Azure Status page for a global view of the health of Azure services.
  
2. Service Health: Provides a more focused view by offering insights into Azure services and regions specifically used by the user. It is the go-to place for service-related communications about outages, planned maintenance, and other health advisories. Users can set up alerts to receive notifications about service issues impacting their Azure services and regions.
  
3. Resource Health: Offers a tailored view of individual Azure resources, such as specific virtual machine instances. Through Azure Monitor, users can configure alerts to notify them of any availability changes to their cloud resources.
  
Azure Service Health combines these three components to provide users with a holistic view of their Azure environment, from the global status of Azure services down to specific resources. It also stores historical alerts, allowing users to review and investigate past incidents. Additionally, in the event of workload impacts, Azure Service Health provides links to support for further assistance.
